<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li>The recent achievements of modern, democratic India are not inconsiderable, and have been widely recognized across the globe over the last decade or more.</li>
<li>India’s record in pioneering democratic governance in the non-Western world is a widely acknowledged accomplishment, as is its basic success in maintaining a secular state, despite the challenges arising from its thoroughly multi-religious population and the hugely problematic history of violence around the ending days of the Raj.</li>
<li>To this can be added the achievement of rapid economic growth in the last decade, when India became the second fastest-growing large economy in the world.</li>
<li>However, it is important to evaluate both the achievements and failures that characterise India today.</li>
<li>Have India’s old problems been eradicated?</li>
